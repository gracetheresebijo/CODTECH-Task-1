OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT:SIMPLE CALCULATOR


OBJECTIVES
The objective of the Python program described (a basic calculator) is to provide a simple tool that allows users to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers.
For beginner programmers, creating a basic calculator serves as a hands-on exercise to practice fundamental concepts such as functions, conditional statements, user input handling, and basic arithmetic operations in Python.
 It provides an interactive user experience where users can input numbers and choose operations, seeing immediate results. This interaction helps reinforce the understanding of how programs can process and respond to user input.

KEY ACTIVITIES
User Input Handling
Arithmetic Operations
Menu Display and User Interaction
Error Handling

TECHNOLOY USED
Python 

KEY INSIGHTS
Implementing functions (add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide()) to encapsulate specific operations demonstrates the importance of modular design.
Insights into how functions can simplify code, promote code reuse, and improve readability.Handling user input effectively, including validation to ensure inputs are of the expected type (numeric) and within acceptable ranges.
Insight into the importance of input validation to prevent errors and ensure the program behaves as intended.
